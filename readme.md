## Features
- Upload images for classification
- Real-time image classification using VGG16 model
- Display classification results with confidence scores
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- Flask (Web framework)
- Keras (Deep learning library)
- VGG16 (Pre-trained model)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend)
- Bootstrap (Responsive design)

## Setup
